            <p><span>When</span>, in the Courſe of human Events, it becomes neceſſary for one People to diſſolve the
                Political Bands which have connected them with another, and to aſſume, among the Powers of the Earth,
                the ſeparate and equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's <span
                    class="uppercase">God</span> entitle them, a decent Reſpect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that
                they ſhould declare the Cauſes which impel them to the Separation.</p>

            <p><span>We</span> hold theſe Truths to be ſelf-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are
                endowed, by their <span class="uppercase">Creator</span>, with certain unalienable Rights, that among
                theſe are Life, Liberty and the purſuit of Happineſs.—That to ſecure theſe Rights, Governments are
                inſtituted among Men, deriving their juſt Powers from the Conſent of the Governed, that whenever any
                Form of Government becomes deſtructive of theſe Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to
                aboliſh it, and to inſtitute new Government, laying its foundation on ſuch Principles, and organizing
                its Powers in ſuch Form, as to them ſhall ſeem moſt likely to effect their Safety and Happineſs.
                Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long eſtabliſhed, ſhould not be changed for light and
                tranſient Cauſeſ; and accordingly all Experience hath ſhewn, that Mankind are more diſpoſed to ſuffer,
                while evils are ſufferable, than to right themſelves by aboliſhing the Forms to which they are
                accuſtomed. But when a long Train of Abuſes and Uſurpations, purſuing invariably the ſame Object evinces
                a Deſign to reduce them under abſolute Deſpotiſm, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off ſuch
                Government, and to provide new Guards for their future Security. Such has been the patient Sufferance of
                theſe Colonieſ; and ſuch is now the Neceſſity which conſtrains them to alter their former Syſtems of
                Government. The Hiſtory of the preſent King of Great-Britain is a Hiſtory of repeated Injuries and
                Uſurpations, all having in direct Object the Eſtabliſhment of an abſolute Tyranny over theſe States. To
                prove this, let Facts be ſubmitted to a candid World.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span>He</span> has refuſed his Aſſent to Laws, the moſt wholeſome and neceſſary for the public
                    Good.</li>

                <li><span>He</span> has forbidden his Governors to paſs Laws of immediate and preſſing Importance,
                    unleſs ſuſpended in their operation till his Aſſent ſhould be obtained; and when ſo ſuſpended, he
                    has utterly neglected to attend to them.</li>

                <li><span>He</span> has refuſed to paſs other Laws for the Accommodation of large Diſtricts of People,
                    unleſs thoſe People would relinquiſh the Right of Repreſentation in the Legiſlature, a Right
                    ineſtimable to them, and formidable to Tyrants only.</li>

                <li><span>He</span> has called together Legiſlative Bodies at Places unuſual, uncomfortable, and diſtant
                    from the Depoſitory of their public Records, for the ſole Purpoſe of fatiguing them into Compliance
                    with his Meaſures.</li>

                <li><span>He</span> has diſſolved Repreſentative Houſes repeatedly, for oppoſing with manly Firmneſs his
                    Invaſions on the Rights of the People.</li>

                <li><span>He</span> has refuſed for a long time, after ſuch Diſſolutions, to cauſe others to be elected;
                    whereby the Legiſlative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for
                    their exerciſe; the State remaining, in the mean Time, expoſed to all the Dangers of Invaſion from
                    without, and convulſions within.</li>

                <li><span>He</span> has endeavoured to prevent the Population of theſe States; for that Purpoſe
                    obſtructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refuſing to paſs others to encourage their
                    Migrations hither, and raiſing the Conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.</li>

                <li><span>He</span> has obſtructed the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, by refuſing his Aſſent to Laws for
                    eſtabliſhing Judiciary Powers.</li>

                <li><span>He</span> has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the Tenure of their Offices, and
                    the Amount and Payment of their Salaries.</li>

                <li><span>He</span> has erected a Multitude of new Offices, and ſent hither Swarms of Officers to
                    harraſs our People, and eat out their Subſtance.</li>

                <li><span>He</span> has kept among us, in Times of Peace, Standing Armies, without the Conſent of our
                    Legiſlatures.</li>

                <li><span>He</span> has affected to render the Military independent of and ſuperior to the Civil Power.
                </li>

                <li><span>He</span> has combined with others to ſubject us to a Juriſdiction foreign to our
                    Conſtitution, and unacknowledged by our Laws; giving his Aſſent to their Acts of pretended
                    Legiſlation:</li>

                <li><span>For</span> quartering large Bodies of Armed Troops among us:</li>

                <li><span>For</span> protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Puniſhment for any Murders which they ſhould
                    commit on the Inhabitants of theſe States:</li>

                <li><span>For</span> cutting off our Trade with all Parts of the World:</li>

                <li><span>For</span> impoſing Taxes on us without our Conſent:</li>

                <li><span>For</span> depriving us, in many Caſes, of the Benefits of Trial by Jury:</li>

                <li><span>For</span> tranſporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended Offences</li>

                <li><span>For</span> aboliſhing the free Syſtem of Engliſh Laws in a neighbouring Province, eſtabliſhing
                    therein an arbitrary Government, and enlarging its Boundaries ſo as to render it at once an Example
                    and fit Inſtrument for introducing the ſame abſolute Rule into theſe Colonies:</li>

                <li><span>For</span> taking away our Charters, aboliſhing our moſt valuable Laws, and altering
                    fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:</li>

                <li><span>For</span> ſuſpending our own Legiſlatures, and declaring themſelves inveſted with Power to
                    legiſlate for us in all Caſes whatſoever.</li>

                <li><span>He</span> has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection, and waging War
                    againſt us.</li>

                <li><span>He</span> has plundered our Seas, ravaged our Coaſts, burnt our Towns, and deſtroyed the Lives
                    of our People.</li>

                <li><span>He</span> is, at this Time, tranſporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to complete the
                    Works of Death, Deſolation and Tyranny, already begun with Circumſtances of Cruelty and Perfidy,
                    ſcarcely paralleled in the moſt barbarous Ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized Nation.
                </li>

                <li><span>He</span> has conſtrained our Fellow-Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas, to bear Arms
                    againſt their Country, to become the Executioners of their Friends and Brethren, or to fall
                    themſelves by their Hands.</li>

                <li><span>He</span> has excited domeſtic Inſurrections amongſt us, and has endeavoured to bring on the
                    Inhabitants of our Frontiers, the mercileſs Indian Savages, whoſe known Rule of Warfare, is an
                    undiſtinguiſhed Deſtruction of all Ages, Sexes, and Conditions.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><span>In</span> every Stage of theſe Oppreſſions We have Petitioned for Redreſs in the moſt humble terms:
                Our repeated Petitions have been anſwered only by repeated Injury. A Prince, whoſe Character is thus
                marked by every Act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the Ruler of a free People.</p>

            <p><span>Nor</span> have We been wanting in Attentions to our Britiſh Brethren. We have warned them from
                Time to Time of Attempts by their Legiſlature to extend an unwarrantable Juriſdiction over us. We have
                reminded them of the Circumſtances of our Emigration and Settlement here. We have appealed to their
                native Juſtice and Magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the Ties of our common Kindred to diſavow
                theſe Uſurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our Connexions and Correſpondence. They too have
                been deaf to the Voice of Juſtice and of Conſanguinity. We muſt, therefore, acquieſce in the Neceſſity,
                which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the Reſt of Mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace
                Friends.</p>

            <p><span>We,</span> therefore, the Repreſentatives of the <strong><span class="uppercase">United
                        States</span> of <span class="uppercase">America</span></strong>, in <strong><span
                        class="uppercase">General Congress</span></strong> Aſſembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of
                the World for the Rectitude of our Intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of
                theſe Colonies, ſolemnly Publiſh and Declare, That theſe United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be,
                <strong><span class="uppercase">Free</span> and <span class="uppercase">Independent
                        States</span></strong>; that they are abſolved from all Allegiance to the Britiſh Crown, and
                that all political Connexion between them and the State of Great-Britain, is, and ought to be,totally
                diſſolved; and that as <strong><span class="uppercase">Free</span> and <span
                        class="uppercase">Independent States</span></strong>, they have full Power to levy War, conclude
                Peace, contract Alliances, eſtabliſh Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which <strong><span
                        class="uppercase">Independent States</span></strong> may of Right do. And for the Support of
                this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the Protection of <strong><span class="uppercase">Divine
                        Providence</span></strong>, we mutually pledge to each other our <em>Lives</em>, our
                <em>Fortunes</em>, and our <em>ſacred Honor</em>.
